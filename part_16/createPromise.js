// The Promises are just a spetial kind of object in JavaScript. The Promise Constructor, takes exactly one argument, and that is so-called executor function; As soon as the promise constructor runs, it will automatically execute this executor function, and it will do so by passing it two other arguments - the resolve and the reject functions;

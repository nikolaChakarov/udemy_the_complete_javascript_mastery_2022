MODULES;
Reusable piece of code that encapsulates implementation details; It is usualy a standalone file, but it doesn't have to be;
Modules are stored in files, exactly one module per file;
Differices betweeen modules and scripts:
1. in modules all top level variables are scoped to the module; So basicaly variables are private to the module by default; And the only way an outside module can access a value that's inside of a module is by exporting that value;
in SCRIPTS on the other hand all top level variables are always global;
2. ES Modules are always executed in strict mode;
3. the THIS key word is always undefined at the top level while in SCRIPTS it points at the window;
